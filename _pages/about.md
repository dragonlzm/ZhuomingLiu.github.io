I am a student of Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California(USC). Previously, I received a bachelor's Degree at Sun Yat-sen University(SYSU).

My research lies in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in Vision-Languauage learning, Learning with Less Labeling.
